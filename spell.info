Overview
********

   GNU Spell is a spell checking program which prints each misspelled
word on a line of its own.  It is designed as a clone of the standard
Unix `spell' program, and implemented as a wrapper for Ispell.  Spell
accepts as its arguments a list of files to read from.  Within that
list, the magical file name `-' causes Spell to read from standard
input.  In addition, when called with no file name arguments, Spell
assumes that it should process standard input.

   Spell is most useful when used in conjunction with other programs,
because its output is minimalistic.  Human users are usually more
comfortable with verbose output.  *note The Ispell Manual: (ispell)Top,
for an screen-oriented spelling checker.

Invoking Spell
**************

   The format for running GNU Spell is:

     spell [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   Spell supports the following options:

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version number of Spell on the standard error output and
     then exit.

`--british'
`-b'
     Use the British dictionary rather than American.  Unavailable
     unless this dictionary was installed with Ispell.

`--dictionary=FILE'
`-d FILE'
     Use the named dictionary.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print an informative help message describing the options and then
     exit.

`--ispell=PROGRAM'
`-i PROGRAM'
     Call PROGRAM as Ispell.

`--all-chains'
`-l'
     Ignored; for compatibility.

`--number'
`-n'
     Print the line number of each misspelled word along with the word
     itself.

`--print-file-name'
`-o'
     Print the file name which contained the misspelled words on each
     line before the word.

`--stop-list=FILE'
`-s FILE'
     Ignored; for compatibility.

`--verbose'
`-v'
     When a word is not found in its literal form in the dictionary, it
     is printed.

`--print-stems'
`-x'
     Ignored; for compatibility.

Example
*******

   Using GNU Spell is quite simple.  Here's an example, which you can
try when in the directory of Spell's source code.

     $ spell --print-file-name --number sample
     sample:1: Tihs
     sample:1: si
     sample:1: fo
     sample:1: Splel
     sample:1: worsd
     sample:1: spellled
     sample:1: worng
     sample:2: fi
     sample:2: cna
     sample:2: dael
     sample:2: fiel
     sample:2: Foo
     sample:2: bza
     sample:2: baz

   The words printed on standard output are all the (purposely)
misspelled words in `sample'.  Notice the options `--print-file-name'
and `--number' (*note Invoking Spell::.).  They are responsible for the
prefix you see on each line, `sample:LINENO '.

Problems
********

   If you find a bug in GNU Spell, or have any questions, comments, or
suggestions about it, please send electronic mail to
`bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  When sending bug reports, include the
version number, which you can find by running `spell --version'.  Also
include in your message the operating system you are using, the output
that the program produced, the output you expected, which options you
invoked Spell with, and any other details that you think may be useful.
Keep in mind that facts are more usually more helpful than guesses.
